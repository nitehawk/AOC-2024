Ideas for part 2
* Scan through the map for obstacles and search+construct loops
* Pickup obstacles seen by guard walk and construct loops
* Brute force:
  * Loop and update each unoccupied map position with an obstacle in turn
  * At each step, walk the map with a breakout when the last 4 turns match
